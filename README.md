Flower Animation using HTML and CSS
Overview
This project consists of HTML and CSS code that creates an animated flower display. The HTML structure provides the framework for the flowers, while the CSS includes styles and animations to render and animate the flowers. The animation involves different colored flowers that fall and rotate, simulating a natural motion.

HTML Structure
The HTML is structured to create three separate flower elements within a container. Each flower consists of a line (stem) and multiple leaves (petals). Additionally, there is a glass container that gives the appearance of flowers in a vase.

CSS Styling and Animations
The CSS styles define the appearance of the background, glass container, stems, and petals of the flowers. Additionally, animations are specified to simulate the petals falling.

Summary
The HTML and CSS code provided create a visually appealing animation of falling flowers. The HTML establishes the structure, while the CSS brings the flowers to life with detailed styling and keyframe animations. This project demonstrates advanced CSS animations and transformations to simulate natural flower movement.
